### django-admin.py 
is a script that will create the directories and files for us.


### manage.py 
is a script that helps with management of the site. 
With it we will be able (amongst other things) to start a web server on our computer without installing anything else.

### settings.py
file contains the configuration of your website.

### urls.py 
file contains a list of patterns used by urlresolver
